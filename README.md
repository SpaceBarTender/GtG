## 2 applications

### 1: An application that scrapes world articles that an LLM hand picks out of based on biblical themes to connect to the modern day.

### 2: Thematic and Symbolic extractor/analyst of the Bible using LLM function calling to systematically extract entities and relationships, then abstract to higher level events, then higher into symbols, then into themes, motifs, etc., represented as nested JSON output, then translated into a graph (potentially a graph neural network) for graphical representation which should enable more subtle clustering analysis of items in the text. Potentially can use the Infinite Relational Model when representing the graph as a graph of tables, or modify the IRM to include the GNN representation of the bible, then perform cluster analysis over that.
